# data-wrangling
In this data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) project, Python was employed to extract, clean, and analyze raw datasets to derive meaningful insights. 
The project aimed to prepare the data for subsequent analysis and visualization, ensuring data quality and uncovering patterns for better decision-making.

Major Importance:

Data Quality Assurance: Data wrangling is crucial for ensuring the quality and integrity of the dataset. Python's Pandas library was leveraged to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring that the data was reliable for analysis.

Data Integration: The project involved merging and integrating multiple datasets using Pandas. This step was essential for creating a comprehensive dataset that captures diverse aspects of the problem domain.

Normalization and Standardization: The data was normalized and standardized to bring uniformity and comparability across different features. This process enhances the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms and statistical analyses.
